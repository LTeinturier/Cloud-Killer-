    """
    Function that does everything basically. 
    Loads the synthetic or EPIC data, then calls the MCMC part on them.
    Make a plot of the lightcurve, the mcmc lightcurve and few samples of the mcmc
    Inputs : numOfSlices : nbr of slices
             Acloud : True cloud albedo used for synthetic data
             w : rotation speed of the planet
             Day : number of Days the simulations is spanning
             nwalkers : number of walkers
             nsteps : number of steps for the mcmc
             timespan : fraction of day the simulation spans
             phispan : fraction of lonfitude the simulation spans
             burning : number of steps to disregard in the mcmc
             plot : to plot or not to plot
             mcmc : to mcmc or not to mcmc
             walker : to plot the walker and cornerplot or not
             forming : not used, but too choose if we generate clouds or not
             Epic : If None, synthetic data is created, otherwise needs to give the Epic data
            
    Ouputs : surface albedo map, fclouds, TOA albedo map, lightcurve, ALbedo of the clouds, computed by the mcmc
            for synthetic data, we also return the true surface, true fclouds, true TOA albedo map, true light curve
            percentile is the 16th and 84th percentil on each paramters, for each slices and days
